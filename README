Warning: work in progress, repository will eventually be removed.

See docs/key-management.md for documentation on how to use this.

See DEMO.txt for an example where 5 YubiHSMs are provisioned to get two backups,
two signing oracles for a log server, and one signing oracle for a witness.

See FAIL.txt for PKCS11 Ed25519 + ssh-agent that's not working; p256 works tho.
